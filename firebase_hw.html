	<p>This is my firebase hw. Though it does not feature firebase, it tells some of the things that I have learned in the course. Hw is about displaying what you have learned as well as learning a bit more when actually doing it.</p>
	<p>Although I haven't mastered any coding things from the class, I've learned that life isn't about mastering things. I used to think that in order to be successful in life, you had to pick one skill, master it, be the best, and the world is then yours.</p>
	<p>At first, I hated that coding was all about googling things and admitting that you didn't know what was going on/how things worked. Now I'm not so sure how I feel about it. With all the technology things slowly excalading so that everything is available to everyone, I'm questioning my past mentality on skills. What is the purpose to mastering a skill? What is the purpose to be the best at something?</p>
	<p>Though I don't have the answers to these questions, I continue to challenge myself to seek out things that I don't know right now because I can do stuff.</p>
	<!-- i turned this in right now cause i kinda forgot that i could only miss 2 hw assignments, and i'm still having a hard time to comprehend mongoose stuff and react as well as trying to help my team's final group project, but i forgot to actually use firebase.. and i didn't want to relearn it just to forget it.. plus it's not really counting for a grade, so i thought to write this to entertain you. hopefully it worked. -->
